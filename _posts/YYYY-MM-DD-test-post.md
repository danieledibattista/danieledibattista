Welcome to my first blog post! In this post, I'll be sharing some tips and tricks for getting started with Jekyll, and I'll also be including an image and a video.

First off, if you're new to Jekyll, it's a static site generator that allows you to build websites quickly and easily. It uses templates and markdown files to generate HTML pages, which makes it perfect for blogs and small websites.

One of the best things about Jekyll is that it's highly customizable. You can choose from a variety of templates, and you can also create your own. You can also use plugins to add additional functionality to your site.

Now, let's take a look at the image I've included in this post:

As you can see, you can easily include images in your Jekyll blog posts using Markdown syntax. Just include the path to the image file, and Jekyll will automatically generate the necessary HTML.

Next, let's take a look at the video I've included in this post:

As you can see, you can also include videos in your Jekyll blog posts using HTML syntax. Just include the necessary HTML code, and Jekyll will include it in the generated page.

That's it for my first blog post with images and videos! Thanks for reading, and I hope you found it helpful. Be sure to check back for more Jekyll tips and tricks in the future.
